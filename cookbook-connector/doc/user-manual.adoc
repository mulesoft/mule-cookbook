== Introduction

The Cookbook is a service that helps users organize ingredients and recipes, so that users can easily find recipes for the foods they like to prepare.

This API allows users to use the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for single & multiple recipes and ingredients. The API also allows you to view recently added recipes.

=== Prerequisites

This document assumes you are familiar with Mule, https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Anypoint+Connectors[Anypoint Connectors], and https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Anypoint+Studio+Essentials[Anypoint Studio Essentials]. To increase your familiarity with Studio, consider completing one or more https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Anypoint+Connector+Tutorial[Anypoint Studio Tutorials]. Further, this page assumes that you have a basic understanding of https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Elements+in+a+Mule+Flow[Mule flows] and https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Global+Elements[Mule Global Elements].

To use the Cookbook connector, you must have the following:

* **Anypoint Studio:** If you don't use Anypoint Studio for development, follow the instructions to install the PeopleSoft Maven dependencies into your pom.xml file .
* **Cookbook Service:** You can start the cookbook service locally or can use the service endpoint exposed in CloudHub. For Authentication details refer to http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-cookbook-tutorial/#_authentication[Cookbook Authentication] section.

---
===== Studio XML Editor
---

* Ensure you have included the **Cookbook namespace** in your configuration file.
```xml
<mule xmlns:cookbook="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/cookbook" xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core" xmlns:doc="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation"
	xmlns:spring="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans" version="EE-3.6.2"
	xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
	xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd
http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/cookbook http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/cookbook/current/mule-cookbook.xsd">
    <!-- use the following global configuration code to create the cookbook config -->

    <cookbook:config name="Cookbook__Configuration" username="${mule.cookbook.username}" password="${mule.cookbook.password}" doc:name="Cookbook: Configuration"/>

    <!-- here go your flow elements -->
</mule>
```
* Save the changes made to the XML file.

== Using This Connector
The Cookbook connector is an operation-based connector, which mean that when you add the connector to you flow, you need to configure a specific operation the connector is intended to perform.
The Connector supports the following operations.

**Message Processors**

* Create
* Get
* Update
* Delete
* QueryPaginated
* GetRecentlyAdded

**Message Sources**

* GetRecentlyAddedSource

**Transformers**

* RecipesToMaps
* RecipeToMap

=== Adding to a Flow
* Create a new *Mule Project* in Anypoint Studio.
* Add a suitable Mule *Inbound Endpoint*, such as the HTTP listener or File endpoint, to begin the flow.
* Drag & drop the *Cookbook Connector* onto the canvas.
* Click on the connector component to open the *Properties Editor*.

[.center.text-center]
image:cookbook_usecase_settings.png[Flow Settings]

* Configure the following parameters:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Field|Description
|`Display Name`|Enter a unique label for the connector in your application.
2+|`*BASIC SETTINGS*`
|`Connector Configuration`|Connect to a global element linked to this connector. Global elements encapsulate reusable data about the connection to the target resource or service. Select the global Cookbook connector element that you just created.
|`Operation`|Select `*Create*` from the drop-down menu.
2+|`*GENERAL*`
|`Type`|Select the type of the entity you want to work with. If you have provided the credentials earlier, the connector would automatically fetch the metadata.
|`Entity Reference`|Provide the entity object that you would like to create.
|===

* Click the blank space on the canvas to save your configurations.

=== Use Cases and Demos
The most common use cases for the Cookbook connector are listed below:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
|`*CRUD*`|Create, Get, Update, and Delete the recipes and ingredients from the repository.
|`*Get Recently Added*`|Retrieves the complete recipe along with ingredients, and directions to prepare the recipe of a recently added, if exists in the repository.
|===

== Example Use Case

Retrieve recently added recipe from the repository.

[.center.text-center]
image:cookbook_usecase_flow.png[Get recently added recipe flow]

=== Anypoint Studio Visual Editor | XML Editor

* Create a new **Mule Project** in Anypoint Studio.
* Edit the `**mule-app.properties**` file placed under `**src\main\app**` folder to hold your Cookbook credentials.

```
mule.cookbook.username=<USERNAME>
mule.cookbook.password=<PASSWORD>
```
* Drag a **HTTP endpoint** into the canvas and configure the following parameters:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|`Display Name`|/HTTP
|`Connector Configuration`| If no HTTP element has been created yet, click the plus sign to add a new **HTTP Listener Configuration** and click **OK** (leave the values to its defaults).
|`Path`|/getrecentlyadded
|`Username`|`${mule.cookbook.username}`
|`Password`|`${mule.cookbook.password}`
|===

TIP: Username and Password use property **placeholder syntax** to load the credentials in a more simple and reusable way. Read more about this practice at https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Configuring+Properties[Configuring Properties].

* Drag the **Cookbook connector** next to the HTTP and configure it according to the steps below:
** Select the **Cookbook Global Element** that you have previously created.

```xml
<cookbook:config name="Cookbook__Configuration" username="${mule.cookbook.username}" password="${mule.cookbook.password}" doc:name="Cookbook: Configuration"/>
```
** Back in the properties editor of the Cookbook connector, configure the remaining parameters:

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|`Display Name`|Get Recently added Recipe (or any other name you prefer).
|`Connector Configuration`|Cookbook__Configuration (the reference name to the global element you have previously created).
|`Operation`|Get recently added
|===

Then, your XML should look like:

[width="50%"]
```xml
<cookbook:get-recently-added config-ref="Cookbook__Configuration" doc:name="Get Recently added Recipe"/>
```
* Add a **Object to XML transformer** to display the response in the browser.
* Add a **Logger** scope after the XML transformer to print the data that is being passed by the Cookbook connector in the Mule Console. Configure the Logger according to the table below.

[options="header,autowidth"]
|===
|Parameter|Value
|`Display Name`|Employee List (or any other name you prefer)
|`Message`|`#[payload]` (the output from DataWeave)
|`Level`|INFO
|===

* Save and **run** the project as a Mule Application.
* Open a web browser and hit the URL `**http://localhost:8081/getrecentlyadded**`. If your Cookbook repository has any recently added recipe, the you should see the XML with the recipe, Otherwise empty.
