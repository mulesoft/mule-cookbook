== What is DevKit

The http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Anypoint+Connector+DevKit[DevKit] is an important part of the Anypoint Platform. It is a Maven based tool that allows developers to build reusable components that not only can be run as part of a Mule application, but also can easily be configured/consumed from http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio].

== When to use it

There are several scenarios in which you may want to build your own connector. Yours might fall under one or more of this scenarios:

* You need to consume an API in one or more applications and you want to make sure everyone uses the same component.
* You have an API and want to add strategic value to your business by providing a connector and telling the world "I am part of Mule Platform".
* You want to facilitate integration with SaaS and on-premise Web services, applications, and data sources.
* The API we are consuming supports Pagination, Batch and/or has a SQL capability.
* The API we are consuming has different entity types and/or their structure can change.
* I want to extend Mule core.

= Prerequisites

To develop a connector you should have a working knowledge of Mule, Anypoint Studio, and Java development in general, specifically the use of Java annotations.

DevKit's functionality is exposed to connector developers through http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/[Java annotations] that generate code and files to interact with Mule, and Anypoint Studio. The generated code provides the interface between the connector and Mule that would otherwise require each connector developer to include extensive boilerplate code, as well as the code and files required to interact with your connector in Anypoint Studio.

You can develop a connector using Windows, Mac, or Linux.

== Setup environment

* Download and install http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html[Java 1.7 JDK].
* Download and install http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven].
* Download http://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule-studio[Anypoint Studio].
* Check http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Maven+Support+in+Anypoint+Studio[Maven configuration] in Anypoint Studio.
* Install Anypoint DevKit plugin.
* Install a http://git-scm.com/downloads[GitHub] client.
* Clone https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-store[tutorial] repository into your local machine.
